There was no chance of a Catching Fire type of ending... all of the other tributes were goners, it was just a matter of when and how. ""Goodbye, Maysilee Donner, who I loathed, then grudgingly respected, then loved. Not as a sweetheart or even a friend. A sister."" Just throw an axe into a forcefield and let it boomerang back into my gut why don't you. It'd hurt less. My one qualm is Snow's character, but that's more of an issue I have with TBOSAS than this book. I know a lot of people disagree, but Snow‚Äôs transformation into the most vile person on the planet doesn‚Äôt add up for me. Sure, he may have always been evil, but this? That‚Äôs neither here nor there, because nothing could stop me from giving this five stars. Also, I loved Plutarch. I wouldn't be upset if we got his story next, but I think what makes these books so compelling is when it‚Äôs from the POV of the districts.

Great Big Beautiful Life,Emily Henry,4.09,Maren‚Äôs Reads,"Alice Scott dreams of one day being a celebrated writer. Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Hayden Anderson already is. When the two compete for the chance to write the history of celebrity heiress Margaret Ives, a woman who has been missing for decades, they have no idea the repercussions Margaret, her story, and the competition will have on their own lives.

Beautiful Ugly,Alice Feeney,3.64,Linzie (suspenseisthrillingme),"Taking place on an enigma of an island with a plot that undeniably matched the setting step for step, Beautiful Ugly was quite possibly Alice Feeney‚Äôs most mind-blowing novel yet. From the twistiest of twists to the deliciously eccentric characters, I was thoroughly immersed in a book that will easily be one of my favorites of the year. It wasn‚Äôt until I closed the gorgeous cover, however, that I was hit with the clever, thought-provoking message. Seemingly much deeper than any of this author‚Äôs prior works, it made me feel all of the feels while also delivering one altogether beautifully written tale. With dual timelines and dual POVs, the characters gleamed with all of their wacky, oddball behavior. Along with an unreliable narrator caught in a locked room mystery plot, the inevitable twists and turns kept me spellbound until the last shocking word. But it was the island itself that made those very words come alive. So intensely evocative that the Isle of Amberly seemed like yet another character in the story, the vivid descriptions brought the smell of salt water to my nose and the sight of misty fog to my eyes.

Welcome to the isle of Amberley - a place so perfectly defined by the title of this book and one that might be giving me nightmares for the next few days!

Beautiful Ugly,Alice Feeney,3.64,Joey R.,"2.0 stars‚Äî-Woe is me. What has become of my favorite author. After absolutely hating ‚ÄúGood Bad Girl‚Äù, I was hoping that Ms. Feeney would have a return to form with her new book, ‚ÄúBeautiful Ugly.‚Äù Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. ‚ÄòBeautiful Ugly‚Äù begins with successful author, Grady, receiving a call from his wife, Abby, that she is returning home with supper. While still on the phone, Abby stops to assist a woman lying across the road. When Grady loses phone contact, he runs to find his wife and is unable to find any trace of her. Grady is forced to go on with his life not knowing what happened to his wife. The story takes off from there as Grady tries resume his career by accepting his agents offer of relocating to a cabin on a sparsely populated island in an attempt to regain his writing mojo. It is at this point I will stop because the story gets weird.. very weird. I can‚Äôt say I enjoyed the rest of the book due to the strangeness of both the plot and main character, Grady. No matter what he sees, hears or happens he be-bops along like Ned in the first reader. Nothing affects this man nor does he ever seem to be bothered by hallucinations, thefts, imaginary phone calls or seeing people who aren‚Äôt really there. Nobody would act like this dolt did with all of the clues surrounding him that something was amiss. The author‚Äôs resolution to the mystery as well as the usual ‚ÄúFeeney Twist‚Äù were downers as well. (I actually hated the Feeney twist in this book because it meant much of the early portions of the book were 100 percent inaccurate ‚Äîwith no indication or reason provided for why. The book‚Äôs open to interpretation ending was also a letdown. The book as a whole was disappointing and I just never got in-step with the cultish vibe it gave off. If someone asked me to sum up this disappointing book in one sentence, I would tell them it is basically the Jordan Peele movie ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äô but with men instead of blacks.",0.052,0.077,"favorite, hoping, successful, accepting, enjoyed, matter, like, like, well","hating, Bad, stops, lying, loses, forced, stop, No, bothered, hated, no, disappointing, disappointing",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211004123-beautiful-ugly,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1722587059i/211004123.jpg

Abby Jimenez is one of those authors who can just sweep me away by just her writing style, but 'Say You'll Remember Me' fell short in so many ways. I would be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy it, because there were times and scenes that I enjoyed‚Äîbut all of them were before the 50% mark, when I was actually invested in the story, rooting for the characters, and enjoying it. But as the story moved forward, the erratic decisions, the constant conflicts thrown, and the decisions made and supported in this book pissed the fuck out of me.

This book is ultimately about the unpleasant bliss of long-distance relationships and how annoying a holier-than-thou brother can be during times of family crises, but there is also an overheated pug, a tired dad, a terrible dad (and mom), and a philosophical question about being a worm. I found it delightful, myself, but I‚Äôm historically easy to please (source: none I made that up I‚Äôm actually very picky and mercurial).

"Fearless (The Powerless Trilogy, #3)",Lauren Roberts,4.21,Clace,"I have been thinking on how to review this book. On one hand, it wasn't as good as some of the people said it was, but honestly, it wasn't a bad book by any means. Yes, some things were handled very poorly, but others were done very well. Powerless was an enjoyable experience for me, but I wanted more from it, Powerful was simply heartbreaking and amazing, Reckless was a heavy victim of the second book syndrome, and Fearless was an enjoyable experience tainted by poor execution. Lauren has the potential to write really good books, there are some scenes in the book which are so beautifully written and the novella 'Powerful' showed a lot of what she can do with a good story. After 'Reckless' my expectations for this book were low, but tbh I was enjoying the first half so much‚Äîlike honestly, I did not have any problems because I was vibing with the book. Me and Rowan both were having fun at the start, and honestly, the romance in this one was going really well too. There were occasional bomb drops of the word 'Pretend' that made my eye twitch, but they were not enough to make me hate it. It was looking out to be 4 stars, but the second half changed so much for me. The pacing, for one, bothered me a lot. At times I would be so invested, but then there would be moments where I wanted it to move along and wrap it up because I felt like it was dragging. She paced this so viciously because those dragged moments would actually make me want to stop, but then a scene would drop that would have me so invested that it just bothered me. The repetitive nature in this part increased, and the 'Pretend' in this part made me wanna dnf this book!!! Like synonyms exist!!! One Google search!!! The plot twists for the sake of shocking us and them serving no purpose were there‚Äîone of them made me gag and I hated it. It really flipped the story and made me disgusted. But honestly, there was just so much going (not in a good way), and it felt like Lauren was having trouble grasping it.

With a blend of introspective first and third person narratives from the points of view of of the five main characters, I was taken into the worried minds and broken hearts of a father, his three children and the woman who washed ashore . It‚Äôs intense as the place that was supposed to be where the seeds for future generations would be saved is also in danger from natural disaster and the lost mind of a researcher. It‚Äôs suspenseful and moving as secrets are revealed. The writing is as beautiful as in McConaghy‚Äôs previous novels and thematically similar with the world in crisis because of climate change . She vividly describes the consequences without preaching. The impact is reflected in this family in crisis.

Wild Dark Shore,Charlotte McConaghy,4.25,Linzie (suspenseisthrillingme),"What an utterly evocative, atmospheric, and lyrical book. From the very start of Wild Dark Shore, I was pulled into a world that felt just as vivid as the characters themselves. In what I can only describe as a love letter to nature, the depth of the descriptions was heart-stoppingly real. Piled on top of the claustrophobic setting, though, was a small cast of characters that had me feeling all of the feels. Transcending the black and white of words on a page, I was touched deeply by an exploration of survival, family, and love that surrounded these five individuals and their heartbreaking story. It was their thoughts and emotions that were told via distinct multiple POVs, however, that had me downright weak in the knees. As for the plot, despite a slow burn first two-thirds, the literary fiction vibe matched nicely with the layers of secrets and lies. Filled with unbridled foreboding and rising suspense, the story of what happened ‚Äúbefore‚Äù captured my mind. And as the storms picked up steam, so too did the events in the novel. You see, a jaw-dropping twist that had me whispering ‚ÄúWait, WHAT?!‚Äù into the night and led to an adrenaline-fueled climax that was simply sublime. Immersive and stunning, as much as I needed to suspend all disbelief, I also could see the events playing out like that for real.

Broken Country,Clare Leslie Hall,4.41,Summer,"Broken Country is a character-driven family story and a love triangle, but at its core, it's an enthralling mystery. I love books that make me feel something I don‚Äôt typically and Broken Country gave me all the feels! From joyous to heartbreaking Broken Country is an emotional rollercoaster but in the best way. The characters are dimensional, flawed, relatable, and very well-written.

Broken Country,Clare Leslie Hall,4.41,Melissa ~ Bantering Books,"I‚Äôm in the minority in that I‚Äôm only giving Broken Country four stars, it seems. It‚Äôs rare to see a review for it here on Goodreads that‚Äôs less than five stars. Clare Leslie Hall may have written a serious contender for many readers‚Äô best book of the year. And I‚Äôm not here to wholly disagree. The book is immersive and engaging, a real page-turner; it‚Äôs a devastating love story, a heartbreaking marital drama, and an intriguing mystery.
