"Sunrise on the Reaping (The Hunger Games, #0.5)",Suzanne Collins,4.61,–º–∞—ò–∞,"i wanna preface this by saying that the hunger games are probably my most re-read books ever, so much so that i can recite paragraphs of them and i also might or might have not written a college paper about them. i also seem to be in the minority of people who enjoyed tbosas, despite having minor issues with it. so trust me when i say that i went into this with an idea that i would at least somewhat enjoy this book. oftentimes when series get really popular, the authors make sequels or spin-offs that are not always that necessary. i respected the fact that Suzanne did not follow this pattern, did not release new books when young adult dystopian fiction was at its peak ‚Äì so i believed that the reason why she published the prequels was because she had something important to say. now i no longer think so and i think this book either needed more time or should not have been published at all. i will try to be detailed and provide all of my reasoning for such a low rating because i am not hating on this book just for the sake of it, believe me ‚Äì if i could choose to like it ‚Äì i would. It would make my life much easier. right off the bat, the writing in this feels a lot clunkier and heavy-handed than the original trilogy. also felt like it was dumbed down, even though the people who are picking this book up are most likely adults who grew up on this series. regardless, YA does not have to mean that the writing is juvenile, which the previous books proved. i remembered i also noticed the difference in writing between tbosas and the original trilogy, and i enjoyed it a bit less because of it... so i was willing to look past it.",0.116,0.027,"enjoyed, trust, enjoy, respected, important, like, original, like, original, enjoyed","hunger, no, low, hating, dumbed",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214331246-sunrise-on-the-reaping,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1729085500i/214331246.jpg

"Sunrise on the Reaping (The Hunger Games, #0.5)",Suzanne Collins,4.61,Brooke Averick,"My god. She has done it again. I can't remember the last time I cried so much while reading. Probably Mockingjay, actually! I found this one particularly heartbreaking because I already knew how it had to end. There could only be one victor. There was no chance of a Catching Fire type of ending... all of the other tributes were goners, it was just a matter of when and how. ""Goodbye, Maysilee Donner, who I loathed, then grudgingly respected, then loved. Not as a sweetheart or even a friend. A sister."" Just throw an axe into a forcefield and let it boomerang back into my gut why don't you. It'd hurt less. My one qualm is Snow's character, but that's more of an issue I have with TBOSAS than this book. I know a lot of people disagree, but Snow‚Äôs transformation into the most vile person on the planet doesn‚Äôt add up for me. Sure, he may have always been evil, but this?

"Sunrise on the Reaping (The Hunger Games, #0.5)",Suzanne Collins,4.61,Emily May,"I was looking forward to this latest Hunger Games book (even though I didn't care for The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes), mostly because I like Haymitch as a character, but I am now fully convinced that this series has no juice left in it. This is a fan book for fans. And, if you're a fan, it has entertaining moments, but nothing about Sunrise on the Reaping is new or necessary. Look, I didn't hate it. The formula and themes of The Hunger Games books are all here-- dramatic reaping, infuriating parading of these kids in front of wealthy sponsors, the bloody action and danger of the games themselves --and it's a formula that has worked before. Obviously, there's less tension this time because you know how it ends. You know Haymitch's attempts to bring down the games cannot have been successful.

"Sunrise on the Reaping (The Hunger Games, #0.5)",Suzanne Collins,4.61,s.penkevich,"More like Sunrise on the WEEPING am I right!? A prequel of pain and punishment in Panem, Sunrise on the Reaping brings the blood, brutality, and betrayal of the Capitol‚Äôs games back for another thrilling and utterly chilling edition of Suzanne Collin‚Äôs The Hunger Games series. Haymitch has always been my favorite and so I had high hopes for this installment. Dear Suzanne Collins, you delivered and more. Collin‚Äôs series signature critiques of propaganda, oppression and rule by fear and force come screaming through this novel where winning isn‚Äôt surviving. it‚Äôs just a different way to die.‚Äô Set about 40 years after the events of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes yet with 24 years still to come before Katniss first steps into the arena in The Hunger Games, Sunrise unveils the tale of Haymitch Abernathy as he is plunged into a fight for his life in the 50th Hunger Games. The return of familiar characters from a new vantage point‚ÄîHaymitch is 16 and ‚Äònot a drinker‚Äô at the outset of this novel‚Äîallows even stories we thought we knew a chance to reveal that Katniss and the reader‚Äôs knowledge of the past was largely filtered through government propaganda and the truth is much more horrifying. There is certainly a lot more reaping than sowing here, and though this novel seems rather hit or miss with fans I found this to be a page-turner of dark excitement and dystopian social criticism that draws us into an unsettling feeling of complicity in the violent voyeurism of The Games that, for all the brutal bleakness, manages to center the fragile humanity and will to endure in a way that keep the story from collapsing under the weight of burdens already well-trod in the series. A fast-paced and fun return to the gruesomeness of Collin‚Äôs dystopian vision, this is an excellent new chapter where moments will make you feel as if your ‚Äò heart breaks into fragments so small it can never be repaired,‚Äô and Collin‚Äôs shows she still has the power to move audiences in new and surprising ways. Because you will never think of squirrels the same again.

Beautiful Ugly,Alice Feeney,3.65,Linzie (suspenseisthrillingme),"Taking place on an enigma of an island with a plot that undeniably matched the setting step for step, Beautiful Ugly was quite possibly Alice Feeney‚Äôs most mind-blowing novel yet. From the twistiest of twists to the deliciously eccentric characters, I was thoroughly immersed in a book that will easily be one of my favorites of the year. It wasn‚Äôt until I closed the gorgeous cover, however, that I was hit with the clever, thought-provoking message. Seemingly much deeper than any of this author‚Äôs prior works, it made me feel all of the feels while also delivering one altogether beautifully written tale. With dual timelines and dual POVs, the characters gleamed with all of their wacky, oddball behavior. Along with an unreliable narrator caught in a locked room mystery plot, the inevitable twists and turns kept me spellbound until the last shocking word. But it was the island itself that made those very words come alive. So intensely evocative that the Isle of Amberly seemed like yet another character in the story, the vivid descriptions brought the smell of salt water to my nose and the sight of misty fog to my eyes.

Beautiful Ugly,Alice Feeney,3.65,Joey R.,"2.0 stars‚Äî-Woe is me. What has become of my favorite author. After absolutely hating ‚ÄúGood Bad Girl‚Äù, I was hoping that Ms. Feeney would have a return to form with her new book, ‚ÄúBeautiful Ugly.‚Äù Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. ‚ÄòBeautiful Ugly‚Äù begins with successful author, Grady, receiving a call from his wife, Abby, that she is returning home with supper. While still on the phone, Abby stops to assist a woman lying across the road. When Grady loses phone contact, he runs to find his wife and is unable to find any trace of her. Grady is forced to go on with his life not knowing what happened to his wife. The story takes off from there as Grady tries resume his career by accepting his agents offer of relocating to a cabin on a sparsely populated island in an attempt to regain his writing mojo. It is at this point I will stop because the story gets weird.. very weird. I can‚Äôt say I enjoyed the rest of the book due to the strangeness of both the plot and main character, Grady. No matter what he sees, hears or happens he be-bops along like Ned in the first reader. Nothing affects this man nor does he ever seem to be bothered by hallucinations, thefts, imaginary phone calls or seeing people who aren‚Äôt really there. Nobody would act like this dolt did with all of the clues surrounding him that something was amiss. The author‚Äôs resolution to the mystery as well as the usual ‚ÄúFeeney Twist‚Äù were downers as well. (I actually hated the Feeney twist in this book because it meant much of the early portions of the book were 100 percent inaccurate ‚Äîwith no indication or reason provided for why. The book‚Äôs open to interpretation ending was also a letdown. The book as a whole was disappointing and I just never got in-step with the cultish vibe it gave off. If someone asked me to sum up this disappointing book in one sentence, I would tell them it is basically the Jordan Peele movie ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äô but with men instead of blacks.",0.052,0.077,"favorite, hoping, successful, accepting, enjoyed, matter, like, like, well","hating, Bad, stops, lying, loses, forced, stop, No, bothered, hated, no, disappointing, disappointing",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211004123-beautiful-ugly,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1722587059i/211004123.jpg

Wild Dark Shore,Charlotte McConaghy,4.27,Linzie (suspenseisthrillingme),"What an utterly evocative, atmospheric, and lyrical book. From the very start of Wild Dark Shore, I was pulled into a world that felt just as vivid as the characters themselves. In what I can only describe as a love letter to nature, the depth of the descriptions was heart-stoppingly real. Piled on top of the claustrophobic setting, though, was a small cast of characters that had me feeling all of the feels. Transcending the black and white of words on a page, I was touched deeply by an exploration of survival, family, and love that surrounded these five individuals and their heartbreaking story. It was their thoughts and emotions that were told via distinct multiple POVs, however, that had me downright weak in the knees. As for the plot, despite a slow burn first two-thirds, the literary fiction vibe matched nicely with the layers of secrets and lies. Filled with unbridled foreboding and rising suspense, the story of what happened ‚Äúbefore‚Äù captured my mind. And as the storms picked up steam, so too did the events in the novel. You see, a jaw-dropping twist that had me whispering ‚ÄúWait, WHAT?!‚Äù into the night and led to an adrenaline-fueled climax that was simply sublime.

"Fearless (The Powerless Trilogy, #3)",Lauren Roberts,4.26,Clace,"I have been thinking on how to review this book. On one hand, it wasn't as good as some of the people said it was, but honestly, it wasn't a bad book by any means. Yes, some things were handled very poorly, but others were done very well. Powerless was an enjoyable experience for me, but I wanted more from it, Powerful was simply heartbreaking and amazing, Reckless was a heavy victim of the second book syndrome, and Fearless was an enjoyable experience tainted by poor execution. Lauren has the potential to write really good books, there are some scenes in the book which are so beautifully written and the novella 'Powerful' showed a lot of what she can do with a good story. After 'Reckless' my expectations for this book were low, but tbh I was enjoying the first half so much‚Äîlike honestly, I did not have any problems because I was vibing with the book. Me and Rowan both were having fun at the start, and honestly, the romance in this one was going really well too. There were occasional bomb drops of the word 'Pretend' that made my eye twitch, but they were not enough to make me hate it. It was looking out to be 4 stars, but the second half changed so much for me. The pacing, for one, bothered me a lot. At times I would be so invested, but then there would be moments where I wanted it to move along and wrap it up because I felt like it was dragging. She paced this so viciously because those dragged moments would actually make me want to stop, but then a scene would drop that would have me so invested that it just bothered me. The repetitive nature in this part increased, and the 'Pretend' in this part made me wanna dnf this book!!! Like synonyms exist!!! One Google search!!! The plot twists for the sake of shocking us and them serving no purpose were there‚Äîone of them made me gag and I hated it. It really flipped the story and made me disgusted. But honestly, there was just so much going (not in a good way), and it felt like Lauren was having trouble grasping it. But besides that, the ending was satisfying and the epilogue was very sweet, even the one at the very end.",0.195,0.166,"good, enjoyable, Powerful, Fearless, enjoyable, good, beautifully, good, enjoying, fun, romance, well, like, want, Like, good, like, satisfying","bad, Powerless, heartbreaking, Reckless, victim, poor, problems, bomb, hate, bothered, viciously, dragged, drop, bothered, repetitive, shocking, no, gag, hated, trouble",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214151222-fearless,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1730330746i/214151222.jpg

Atmosphere,Taylor Jenkins Reid,4.47,The Bookish Elf,"Taylor Jenkins Reid has built her reputation crafting intimate character studies against the backdrop of fascinating historical moments, from the golden age of Hollywood in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo to the 1970s rock scene in Daisy Jones & The Six. With Atmosphere, she ventures into new territory - both literally and metaphorically - by setting her latest novel within NASA's Space Shuttle program of the 1980s. The result is an ambitious and emotionally resonant story that explores love, sacrifice, and human connection against the vastness of space.

Atmosphere,Taylor Jenkins Reid,4.47,Roman Clodia,This has such a gripping premise: the first female astronauts on NASA's space shuttle programme. But somehow the characters never came fully to life and there was lots of draggy domestic stuff as well as a rather cheesy and predictable love affair. It's strange because the 1984 sections set on a damaged space shuttle had me biting my nails as the tension ramps up and even the intentionally emotive conversations here had me totally gripped.,0.1,0.107,"well, love","strange, damaged, tension",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220817728-atmosphere,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1730469032i/220817728.jpg
